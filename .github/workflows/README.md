This is a GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll website to GitHub Pages. The workflow will run on pushes to the main branch, and can also be manually triggered. The GITHUB_TOKEN is given appropriate permissions to allow deployment to GitHub Pages. The workflow uses the actions/checkout@v3, actions/configure-pages@v3, actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1, and actions/deploy-pages@v1 actions. The first step checks out the code, the second step sets up the Pages environment, the third step builds the Jekyll site, and the fourth step uploads the artifact to GitHub. The deployment step deploys the site to GitHub Pages, and creates an environment with a URL that is available as an output of the deployment step.

After the workflow has been set up, whenever a push is made to the main branch, or when the workflow is manually triggered, the steps outlined in the workflow will be executed. If everything runs successfully, the Jekyll site will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages, and the environment will be available with the URL specified in the output of the deployment step.

This is a GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages. The workflow is named "Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled".

The workflow is triggered in two ways:

On pushes to the "main" branch
When the workflow is manually triggered from the Actions tab
The GITHUB_TOKEN is given the necessary permissions (read access to contents, write access to pages, and write access to the id-token) to allow deployment to GitHub Pages. Only one deployment can run concurrently using the "pages" group and if another deployment is in progress, it will be cancelled.

The workflow contains two jobs:

Build job

Runs on an Ubuntu latest environment
Four steps are executed:
Checkout: uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to checkout the code
Setup Pages: uses the actions/configure-pages@v3 action to set up the Pages environment
Build with Jekyll: uses the actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1 action to build the Jekyll site, with the source and destination specified
Upload artifact: uses the actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1 action to upload the artifact
Deployment job

Runs on an Ubuntu latest environment
Depends on the successful completion of the build job
Has one step:
Deploy to GitHub Pages: uses the actions/deploy-pages@v1 action to deploy the site to GitHub Pages. The environment name and URL are specified, and the URL is available as an output of the step.
If the workflow runs successfully, the Jekyll site will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages.
